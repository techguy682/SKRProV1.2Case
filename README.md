# SKRProV1.2Case

## Untested Model ##

This is a case for the SKR Pro V1.2 intended for use with the MPCNC.

There are two versions:
- Fan: there is a hole for the fan and standoffs/screw holes.
- No Fan: there is no hole for the fan.

You will need M3 screws of varying lengths for the board, fan, and lid. At minimum:
- 4 M3x6 (board), 
- 4 M3x10 (fan, if using; may need different length), and 
- 4 M3 of any length (lid, the holes are 16-20mm long).
